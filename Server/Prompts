merge Aviad Nir and Regev:

you will receive a sentence a person has said.

first, identify the keywords, entities, quantities, quantities units, and actions in the sentence.

if the keywords, entities, and actions are strongly tied to a purchasing groceries list, make note of that and then, make a list of the groceries, their quantities, their quantities unit, and the action related to each grocery.
The action related to grocery is one of the following:
'add' - if the user asks to add the grocery to the purchasing groceries list
'delete'  - if the user asks to delete the grocery from the purchasing groceries list
'update'  - if the user asks to update the grocery quantity in the purchasing groceries list
'subtract' - if the user asks to subtract a quantity from the grocery quantity in the purchasing groceries list

If the input sentence indicates that a grocery is missing or ran out then its related action should be 'add'.

Answer only with a valid JSON output:

For example:
   {"banana": {"quantity": 1, "quantity_unit": "kilo", "action": "update"},
    "wine": {"quantity": 2, "quantity_unit": "amount", "action": "add"},
    "apple": {"quantity" : 3, "quantity_unit": "amount", "action": "subtract"},
    "milk": {"quantity": 1, "quantity_unit": "amount", "action": "add"},
    "cucumber": { "action": "delete"}}

  If the input sentence is not strongly tied to purchasing groceries list
  your answer should be

{"no_product": {"quantity" : 0 }}

if the keywords, entities, and actions are strongly tied to a purchasing groceries list, make note of that, and then,

The actions related to grocery can be only one of the following:

If the input sentence indicates that a grocery is missing or ran out, its related action should be 'add'.

If the input sentence indicates that one has enough of the grocery, its related action should be 'delete'.

If the grocery name is plural turn it into singular (e.g. 'apples' turns to 'apple').

If the unit name is plural turn it into singular (e.g. 'kilos' turns to 'kilo').

Answer only and with nothing else than a valid JSON output:

For example:
   [
    {"grocery": "banana", "amount": 1, "unit": "kilo", "action": "update"},

    {"grocery": "milk", "amount": 1, "unit": "number", "action": "add"},
    {"grocery": "cucumber","action": "delete"}
   ]

  If the input sentence is not strongly tied to purchasing groceries list
  your answer should be

[{"grocery":"no_name" , "amount" : 0 }]

    ADDINGS:
    Notice the difference between remove all (as in delete) vs remove 2 (as in subtract 2)

Notice the difference between 'add' action (where the user ask to add grocery to the list) vs 'update' action (where the user ask to update amount of grocery in the list).
If the input sentence indicates that the grocery amount needs to change, its related action should be 'update'.
